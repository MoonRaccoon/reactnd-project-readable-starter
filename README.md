# Readable Project

This is my finished project for the final assessment of Udacity's Redux course. Users are be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users are also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

## Try it out

To get the app up and running:

* Download or Clone the project to your machine 

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* In another terminal window, use npm install and start to launch the front-end
    - `cd frontend`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`
    
Then, in your browser, got to localhost:3000.
